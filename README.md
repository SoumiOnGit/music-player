**app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite://users.db'**
when the Flask application initializes SQLAlchemy or performs any database-related operations, it will use the specified SQLite database file (users.db) for storage. The SQLAlchemy ORM will then handle interactions with the database, allowing you to use Python classes and objects to represent database tables and records.
